As a Runner
I want to enter a time for a specific distance and get a prediction for other distances.

Tasks:
  * Time entry control
  * Time entry validation
  * Other distance selection - from predefined list, manual entry
  * Prediction calculator
  * Prediction display
  * Storage of predictions?


(original requirement:
Predicts times for different distances based upon a known time that the user enters - for example if someone has run a timed 5k, such as a ParkRun, they can enter their time to get predicted times for 10k/10miles/half marathon/marathon (or any distance they enter))
